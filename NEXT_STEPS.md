# Project Status & Next Steps

## Repository Status
- Current branch: `work`
- Working tree is clean; there are no uncommitted changes pending locally.
- No divergence from the upstream remote is detectable from the current repository configuration (no tracked remote branch configured for `work`).

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Verify remote configuration.** Ensure the local `work` branch tracks the desired remote branch (e.g., `origin/work`). If it does not, follow the “Publishing the `work` branch” steps below from a machine where you have GitHub credentials.
2. **Smoke test the workspace.** From the repo root, run `pnpm install`, then in parallel:
   - `pnpm --filter server dev` to start the Colyseus server.
   - `pnpm --filter web dev` to run the Next.js client.
   Confirm the game client can connect, synchronize world state, and render the arena without runtime errors.
3. **Stabilize integration tests.** Add automated end-to-end checks (Playwright or Vitest + Colyseus mocks) covering player join/leave, orb respawn, and tagging mechanics to prevent regressions.
4. **Polish UI feedback.** Revisit latency indicators, connection banners, and loading states in `apps/web` to ensure they reflect the latest networking hooks and store conventions.
5. **Document deployment steps.** Capture the process for deploying both server and web apps (e.g., Docker compose, hosting targets) to help teammates bring environments back quickly.

Keeping these steps tracked will make it easier to resume feature work with confidence.

## Publishing the `work` branch

If you are new to Git and need to share the current branch with GitHub, run these commands **on your own machine** inside the repository folder (for example, inside `didactic-robot/`). Replace `<username>` and `<repo>` with the actual GitHub path you sent earlier (for example `smmas2g/didactic-robot`).

```bash
# 1. Tell Git where the GitHub repository lives.
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>.git

# 2. Publish the local branch and remember the connection for next time.
git push --set-upstream origin work
```

- You only need to run `git remote add origin …` once per clone. Git will remember it for future pushes.
- After the `git push` finishes, refresh the branch list on GitHub—you should now see `work` listed.
- Future pushes from the same branch can use the shorter `git push` command because the upstream relationship has been set.
